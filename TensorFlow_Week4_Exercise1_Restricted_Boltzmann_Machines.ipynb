    "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n",
    "<b>Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM):</b>  RBMs are shallow neural nets that learn to reconstruct data by themselves in an unsupervised fashion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Why are RBMs important?</h4>\n",
    "It can automatically extract <b>meaningful</b> features from a given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n",
    "RBM is a 2 layer neural network. Simply, RBM takes the inputs and translates those into a set of binary values that represents them in the hidden layer. Then, these numbers can be translated back to reconstruct the inputs. Through several forward and backward passes, the RBM will be trained, and a trained RBM can reveal which features are the most important ones when detecting patterns.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>What are the applications of RBM?</h4>\n",
    "RBM is useful for <a href='http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~hinton/absps/netflixICML.pdf'>  Collaborative Filtering</a>, dimensionality reduction, classification, regression, feature learning, topic modeling and even <b>Deep Belief Networks</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Is RBM a generative or Discriminative model?</h4>\n",
    "RBM is a generative model. Let me explain it by first, see what is different between discriminative and generative models: \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Discriminative:</b> Consider a classification problem in which we want to learn to distinguish between Sedan cars (y = 1) and SUV cars (y = 0), based on some features of cars. Given a training set, an algorithm like logistic regression tries to find a straight line—that is, a decision boundary—that separates the suv and sedan.  \n",
    "<b>Generative:</b> looking at cars, we can build a model of what Sedan cars look like. Then, looking at SUVs, we can build a separate model of what SUV cars look like. Finally, to classify a new car, we can match the new car against the Sedan model, and match it against the SUV model, to see whether the new car looks more like the SUV or Sedan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generative Models specify a probability distribution over a dataset of input vectors. We can do both supervise and unsupervised tasks with generative models:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>In an unsupervised task, we try to form a model for P(x), where P is the probability given x as an input vector.</li>\n",
    "    <li>In the supervised task, we first form a model for P(x|y), where P is the probability of x given y(the label for x). For example, if y = 0 indicates whether a car is a SUV or y = 1 indicates indicate a car is a Sedan, then p(x|y = 0) models the distribution of SUVs’ features, and p(x|y = 1) models the distribution of Sedans’ features. If we manage to find P(x|y) and P(y), then we can use <code>Bayes rule</code> to estimate P(y|x), because: $$p(y|x) = \\frac{p(x|y)p(y)}{p(x)}$$</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "Now the question is, can we build a generative model, and then use it to create synthetic data by directly sampling from the modeled probability distributions? Lets see. "

    "Think RBM as a model that has been trained based on images of a dataset of many SUV and Sedan cars. Also, imagine that the RBM network has only two hidden nodes, one for the weight and, and one for the size of cars, which in a sense, their different configurations represent different cars, one represent SUV cars and one for Sedan. In a training process, through many forward and backward passes, RBM adjust its weights to send a stronger signal to either the SUV node (0, 1) or the Sedan node (1, 0) in the hidden layer, given the pixels of images. Now, given a SUV in hidden layer, which distribution of pixels should we expect? RBM can give you 2 things. First, it encodes your images in hidden layer. Second, it gives you the probability of observing a case, given some hidden values.\n",

    "<b>Phase 1) Forward pass:</b>  Input one training sample (one image) <b>X</b> through all visible nodes, and pass it to all hidden nodes. Processing happens in each node in the hidden layer. This computation begins by making stochastic decisions about whether to transmit that input or not (i.e. to determine the state of each hidden layer). At the hidden layer's nodes, <b>X</b> is multiplied by a <b>$W_{ij}$</b> and added to <b>h_bias</b>. The result of those two operations is fed into the sigmoid function, which produces the node’s output, $p({h_j})$, where j is the unit number. \n",

That is, RBM uses inputs x to make predictions about hidden node activations. For example, imagine that the values of $h_p$ for the first training item is [0.51 0.84]. It tells you what is the conditional probability for each hidden neuron to be at Phase 1): \n",

The positive pixels will increase the probability of activation in hidden units (after multiplying by input/visible pixels), and negative pixels will decrease the probability of a unit hidden to be 1 (activated).
